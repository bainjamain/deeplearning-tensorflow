# Deep Learning with TensorFlow (discontinued)

This repository has been discontinued. Check out my [PyTorch repository](https://github.com/benmyara/deeplearning-pytorch) for more examples. The PyTorch repository is under active work and being updated on a regular basis.

This repository aims at helping people start practically with deep learning with very detailed examples. The implementation of very popular architectures are presented in notebooks with useful comments and links. Some less classical and more novel architecturesbut yet powerful are also presented.

The framework used is [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) via its python API.
